### This repo contains all the important resources and workspace notebooks as mentioned in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
<br>
<br>

**You need to have a proper GPU service for launching and running the Jupyter Notebooks.If you don't have a GPU service, you can still go through via [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#) or [AWS Services:Amazon SageMaker](https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=ap-south-1#/dashboard).**
<br>


## The steps needed to go through this resource:-
**1**.  **Clone the repository** ``git clone https://github.com/blackeye735/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Workspace``<br>
**2**.  Install **Ananoconda** or Install **Pip** utility <br>
**3**.  Run ``pip install jupyter notebook``(for pip) or Run ``conda jupyter notebook`` <br>
**4**.  Go through the **README.md** file to understand the project <br>
**5**.  Run the Notebook (.ipynb files) to get the appropriate results.<br>

_**I had been lucky enough to get a month free trial for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.Starting from 30th of April, I completed each and every workspace, and submitted each and every project on 26th of May.**_

## The reward that I got is:-
![Udacity Deep Learning Certificate](https://github.com/blackeye735/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Workspace/blob/master/udacity_certificate.jpg)
